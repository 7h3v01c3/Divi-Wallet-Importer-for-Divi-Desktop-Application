### UPDATE

Unfortunately, a native macOS app isn’t going to happen. Developing for macOS proved to be a massive time sink for me, as I worked on this as a volunteer and cannot justify the personal cost to continue investing in this anymore. While the Windows version is a gift to the community, the macOS version is too problematic to finish—thanks to its ecosystem. Unless enough Mac users come forward to help fund further development or get other developers involved, it’s not going to happen. Alternatively, since the code is open source, someone else could fork it and complete it freely. Or you can fork the repo and run it in an IDE like PyCharm or VS Code.
